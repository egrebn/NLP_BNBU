<!-- Workspace-specific instructions for GitHub Copilot -->

## Project Overview
This is a Python notebooks workspace for teaching Natural Language Processing (NLP) to students. The workspace contains educational Jupyter notebooks that are shared via git repository.

## Development Guidelines
- All notebooks should be well-documented with markdown cells explaining concepts
- Code cells should include comments for clarity
- Use clear variable names suitable for educational purposes
- Include examples and exercises for students
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-documented

## Project Structure
- Notebooks are organized by topic
- Each notebook should be self-contained when possible
- Include a requirements.txt for Python dependencies

## Best Practices
- Use relative imports when possible
- Document all external dependencies
- Provide clear instructions for running notebooks
- Include expected outputs in markdown cells when appropriate
